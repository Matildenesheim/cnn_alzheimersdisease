# üß† Classifying the Severity of Dementia in Alzheimer‚Äôs Disease:
### Using Convolutional Neural Network in a Multiclass Classification Task
[![describtor - e.g. python version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python%20Version->=3.6-blue)](www.desired_reference.com)

a CNN classifying severities of dementia in Alzheimer's disease (4 classes), presenting an accuracy of 0.56.
Developed in 2020.

The CNN obtained an accuracy of 0.56 for predicting stages of severity in Alzheimer‚Äôs disease following the tenth epoch (loss value ‚âà 1.1), performing well above chance level. Higher accuracies and lower loss values were obtained in the seventh (accuracy ‚âà 0.67, loss value ‚âà 0.77) and eighth epoch (accuracy ‚âà 0.67, loss value ‚âà 0.74).
As the CNN produced an accuracy of 0.56 in a multiclass classification task, this presents promising results for further research in the area of classifying the severity of dementia in Alzheimer‚Äôs disease using MRI images.
